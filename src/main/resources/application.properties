# --- RENDER DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS ---
# Tell Spring to listen on the port Render provides via the PORT environment variable.
# If PORT isn't set (like during local dev), it will default to 8080.
server.port=${PORT:8080}

# This is a crucial setting for cloud deployments. It tells Spring to wait
# for the database to be available before fully starting up.
spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true

# --- Database Connection ---
# THIS IS THE KEY FIX: We take Render's DATABASE_URL and add "jdbc:" to the front.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:${DATABASE_URL}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# --- JPA/Hibernate Settings ---
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# --- JWT Properties ---
app.jwtSecret=${APP_JWTSECRET}
app.jwtExpirationInMs=86400000

# --- Redis Cache Configuration ---
# We disable caching on Render to stay on the free tier.
